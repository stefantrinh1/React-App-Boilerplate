## Construction

Please see package.json webpack.config and .babelrc files to view the dependancies and settings to set up the bare minimum for a react app.

## Build Desciption and Construction

- [Javascript ES5/ES6](https://github.com/topics/javascript)
- [React JS](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [Webpack with Babel Presets](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Installation

1. Open the Command Line(CMD) or Terminal in the folder you wish to insert the boilerplate into.

2. Copy into the CMD/Terminal:

> git clone https://github.com/stefantrinh1/React-App-Boilerplate.git


3. Once the repository has been cloned. change the directory to the application react-boilerplate-app. Once the terminal is open on the application folder, follow the next step. (Before doing the next step make sure you have node.js installed on your computer)s

4. In the Command Line type: 

> npm install

- This will install all the dependancies needed to run the application.

5. In the Command Line type: 

> npm run build

- This will start webpack and bundle all the files together into one file and convert all the ES6 code into ES5 code so the broswers can recognise the language.

6. In the Command Line type: 

> npm start

 - Once you have run this. The application will run live server and babel in the background. The application will then start in a localhost and be running in your broswer from a local position.

 Now your good to start developing!
